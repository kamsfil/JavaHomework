I loved you, and that love, to die refusing,
May still who knows! be smouldering in my breast
Pray be not pained believe me, of my choosing
I’d never have you troubled or distressed.
I loved you mutely, hopelessly and truly,
With shy yet fervent tenderness aglow;
Mine was a jealous passion and unruly…
May God grant that another’ll love you so!
